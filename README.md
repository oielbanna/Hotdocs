# Hotdocs
### This project was implemented for McGill EXCESS Codejam 2018.
The idea is to take a picture of any piece of text and the program tries to generate a normal word document that you can use and edit out of that.
Runs on: 
- Java
- OpenCV for image analysis
- Tess4j wrapper as Tesseract for OCR
- Apache POI 3.14 to create the word document
